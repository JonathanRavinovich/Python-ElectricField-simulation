# Python-ElectricField-simulation
This is a project that i made when i was 16 years old for my computational science class
This code is a simulation of an electric field and charged particles and how they are reacting depending on their mass, charge, etc.
To caculate the force and the movement i used vectors and equations such coulomb's law.
I used tkinter for the gui.
